My reading notes for **Class 13**


#### Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?

Because the web is stateless, but sometimes you want to store information, and you don't want to use a server.

#### What information should not be stored in local storage?

No sensitive information such as passwords.

#### Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?

It can only store strings so you can change that using json.parse and json.stringify.


## Things I want to know more about

Spend more time with Locate Storage.
