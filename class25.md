My reading notes for **Class 5**

#### What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?

The alt attribute of the image tag is used to describe the img being displayed.

#### How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?

You can use the alt attribute to descibe the image so viewers who are visually impaired can understand what the image is.

#### Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.

A figure element is useful when you want to use an image for an example but also need context behind the image.

#### Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.

A gif is a format that's good for animations. An svg is good for drawings or logos.

#### What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?

I would use PNG, which will allow you to display the full image without loosing much detail.

#### Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.

A foreground is like the drawing on a piece of paper while the background is the paper itself.

#### Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?

 I would want to use colors that are easy on the eyes and work well together, combing both the color and background-color attributes for all elements.

#### What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?

 When choosing a font for your website, you should ensure that you are using a web safe font, as they can be used on most, if not all, operating systems.

#### What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?

* font-size: font in measurements
* font-weight: the boldness of the font
* font-style: mainly for the italics

#### Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element.

* line-height: spacing between the lines
* letter-spacing: the spacing between the characters
