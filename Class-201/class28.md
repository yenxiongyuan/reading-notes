My reading notes for **Class 8**

#### Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.

This means it really excels and displaying items as a row or column in the best way possible.

#### Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.

Main axis is set with the flex-direction property if it is set to row the main axis is a row but if it is set to a column the main axis is a column.

#### How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

Things like row-reverse and column reverse change the order of the items on the page which makes the items out of order compared to the html document which can confuse the user.

#### What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?

Flexbox can work better than floats by:
* Being able to vertically center blocks of content
* Making cotainers take up equal amounts of available width and height
* Making all columns adopt the same height

#### How does this topic connect with your long term goals?

This information will give me ideas for ways to more precisely control the layout of webpages.
