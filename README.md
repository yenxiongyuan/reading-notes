# About Me

My name is Yen Xiong Yuan. I am US Veteran. Now a real estate agent in PA. I like problems solving even when I was a young kid. One day I was reading on the internet and Code Fellows pops up on my screen. I read the about page on their website. At that moment I knew I want to do software development. After a week I signed up for their course, even I do not have any experience about coding. I will read and practice coding, whenever I have some free time. Hopefully in the future I will even get a job in the tech field.  


This is my [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/yenxiongyuan).
