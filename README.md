What is *growth mindset*?

Growth Mindset is a self-percetion that people hold about themselves. Having a growth mindset means that you believe basic abilities can be developed through hard work, dedication and persistence, which in turn can improve intelliegence and performance.

What are 3 reminders to myself to keep in a growth mindset?

1. It's never too late to learn.
2. I am at the starting point of my potential. 
3. It's ok if I fail, at least I learned something.
4. ~~Just quit~~.
