# About Me

I have worked in the US Navy for 6 years and several industries before discovering I have a passion for technology. I am a curious developer always wanting to learn new technologies and programming languages. I have been told I have great attention to details when I am working on a project. I love to build and create, but beyond that I have a passion for developing software that solves everyday problems. In the future, I see myself in an organization that values collaboration, ethics, and room to grow both personally and professionally.
