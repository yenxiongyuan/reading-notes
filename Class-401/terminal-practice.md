My reading notes for **Practice in the Terminal**

#### The Command Line - What is it, how does it work and how do I get to one.

When you want a computer to do something, you can give it a prompt which is like a message or request. This tells the computer what you want it to do. 

#### Basic Navigation - An introduction to the Linux directory system and how to get around it.

If we want to find something in our computer, we can use the "cd" command to go to different folders, or use "ls -l" to see a list of all the folders in our computer. This way we can find what we're looking for.

#### More About Files - Find out some interesting characteristics of files and directories in a Linux environment.

In Linux, everything is like a file, even folders. You can move and use them like you would a regular file,  but you have to be careful because Linux is picky about upper and lower case letters in the names of files and folders. Also you have to know the exact location or "path" of the file or folder you want to use, otherwise Linux won't be able to find it.

#### Manual Pages - Learn how to make the most of the Linux commands you are learning.

The manual pages are like a big book that tells you everything you need to know about the different commands you can use on your computer. They explain what each command does, how to use them, and what information you can give them to work properly. It's like having a big instruction manual to help you with your computer.

#### File Manipulation - How to make, remove, rename, copy and move files and directories.

* mkdir - create(folder)
* touch - create(file)
* rmdir <directory name>
* cp [options]<source><destination> - copying file or directory
* mv [options]<source><destination> - moving file or directory
