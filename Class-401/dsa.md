My reading notes for **Data Structures and Algorithms**


#### What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

It's important to think about what kind of information you're working with and what you want to do with it. The most important thing is to figure out what information you're putting in and what information you want to get out. This will help you choose the right way to organize the information so you can solve your problem.
