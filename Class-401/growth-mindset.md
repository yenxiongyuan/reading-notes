My reading notes for **The Growth Mindset**


#### Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice

Deliberate practice means taking the time to practice things that are tough, but it's worth it because it helps you get better faster. When you work on the things that are hardest for you, you will learn the most and see the biggest rewards in the end.

#### Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset

The growth mindset means you are open to trying new things, even if they are hard. You know that by working hard and facing challenges, you will get better and smarter. This kind of attitude helps you stay positive and excited about learning and growing.

#### Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit

Grit means being really passionate and determined about something, and sticking with it even when it gets tough. It's like running a long race, where you keep going even when it gets hard, instead of giving up. When you have grit, you keep working hard day after day, year after year, until you reach your goal.

#### Alain de Botton on Redefining Success

When you're constantly comparing yourself to others and looking at who is better or worse than you, it can make it harder to feel happy and successful. The world can seem like a competition, where there is always someone who is better or worse than you. But remember, it's important to focus on yourself and your own goals, and not worry too much about what others are doing.

#### Assess your Bias

Sometimes it can be hard for me to talk to others because English is not my first language. I might worry about using the right words. But, I'm really good at listening to what others have to say. I pay attention to their advice and opinions, and try to figure out what's good and what's not. I use the good things to help me, and don't worry too much about the bad things.
