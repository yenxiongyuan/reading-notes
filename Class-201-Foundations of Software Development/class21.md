#### Compose a short poem describing how HTTP sends data between computers.

The browser sends an HTTP request message to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website to the client. This message, and all other data sent between the client and the server, is sent across your internet connection using TCP/IP.

#### Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.

HTML, CSS, and JS are parsed separately in the browser. The browser will first read the HTML file which then will point it in the direction of any link or script elements which would contain CSS or JS files. Once a request has been sent for those CSS and JS files the browser will store an in memory tree for the html and an in memory structure for the CSS and JS. Once the browser executes the JS the user then can see the web page and interact with it.
