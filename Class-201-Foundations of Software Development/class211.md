My reading notes for **Class 11**

#### Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.

You needed to use plugins like Flash or Silverlight to have audio or video on the web.

#### Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the video element.

* Src: like image files and indicates the source of the video.
* Controls: used for audio and video playback, start, stop, and adjust volume.

#### Why is it important to have fallback content inside the video element?

Allows for browsers that don't support the video element to fallback onto older browsers.

#### How does Grid layout differ from Flex?

Flex is for one dimensional layout and Grid is for two dimensional.

#### Grid container, grid item, and grid line are a few important terms to understand when using Grid. Please describe these terms in a few sentences.

* Grid Container: The area where the grid envelopes
* Grid Item: Children elements of Grid Container
* Grid Line: The lines that define the grid and the starting and ending points for the rows and columns

#### Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?

It can help to save bandwidth.

#### Define the following img attributes srcset and sizes. Write an example of how they are used.

* srcset is a set of images and its size that a browser can choose to display   
ex. img srcset = "myself-100w.jpg 100w, myself-200w.jpg 200w, myself-300w.jpg 300w"

* sizes defines a set of conditions that will choose the best size image for the browser to display    
ex. size = "(Max width: 400px) 300px"

#### How is srcset more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?

Images are preloaded in CSS and JavaScript before adjusting to page size.
