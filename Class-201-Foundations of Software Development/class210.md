My reading notes for **Class 10**

#### Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

* Syntax Error: mainly spelling errors
* Logic Error: code is not what you intended it to be and produces the wrong results.

#### List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

* Syntax Error: Use the console to check for error.
* Logic Error: Rethink the order of the logic.

#### How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

Help think better in logical way.

#### How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

The JavaScript Debugger lets you see your code working piece by piece and allows you to identify the problems easily.

#### Define what a breakpoint is.

Used to pause your code exectution while debugging.

#### What is the call stack?

Call stack shows you what code has been executed so far.
