My reading notes for **Class 9**

#### Why are forms so important in web development?

They allow you to take input from the user, such as names, age, address, and other key information to make databases for easier access.

#### When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?

Make sure everything is labeled correctly and instructions are given clearly so the user knows exactly what to do.

#### List 5 form elements and explain their importance.

* Label: provides context
* Input: the user's data
* Text Area: Inputs text
* Button: To submit a form
* Form: The actual form

#### How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?

Event listeners are like a sound board, you click the button and depending on what the button is programmed for it will trigger that specific program.

#### When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?

* Type: the name of the event the eventlistener is waiting for
* Listener: What receives the trigger

#### Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?

It is a parameter that gets plugged into the event handler, it helps pass on information from the event object to the event handler.

#### What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?

The capturing phase checks from the outside in while bubbling checks from inside out, the capturing phase checks the main parent first but bubbling checks the direct parent and outwards.

## Things I want to know more about

Spend more time with HTML Forms and JS Events.
