# WHAT IS MARKDOWN?

Markdown is a simple way to format text for the web without writing any HTML. It is used to add formatting to plain text. Markdown can be easily converted into HTML which will then be shown as fully-formatted text. Markdown is meant to be very easy to write, and also very easy to read â€“ and uses common keyboard symbols that are noticeably related the purpose they are used for.

## Markdown basic syntax

### Headings

You can use up to up to six levels by writing # at the start of a line; the number of hashtags defines the hierarchy of the heading.

`# First level heading`  
`## Second level heading`  
`### Third level heading`  

### Strikethrough

You can use double tildes to make strikethrough text:

`~~strikethrough~~`

### Numbered lists

Type 1. then a space. Any number (followed by a full stop and space) can be used and the list items will be ordered from 1 when exported.

1. Ordered list item
2. Ordered list item
3. Ordered list item

### Bulleted lists

Type *, - or + then a space. Create a bulleted list by using an asterisk (*), hyphen (-), or plus sign (+), followed by a space.

* Bulleted list item
* Bulleted list item
* Bulleted list item

### Links

Create a link by surrounding the link text in square brackets, followed immediately by the URL in parentheses:

`[text to link](http://example.com/)`

### Images

Both local and web URLs are supported. Markdown uses the following syntax for images:

`![](http://example.com/image.jpg)`    
`![](./image.jpg)`
