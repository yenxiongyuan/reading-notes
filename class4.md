## What is a Wireframe?

In the simplest of terms, a wireframe is a step between finalizing your sitemap and starting the actual design of your site. It’s essentially your site’s blueprint. With more detail than a sitemap but less detail than the design mock-up, the wireframe allows you and your web designer to take an in-depth look at the functionality your site will have and the content that your site will need.

## What is a HTML?

HTML stands for "Hypertext Markup Language." HTML is the language used to create webpages. "Hypertext" refers to the hyperlinks that an HTML page may contain. "Markup language" refers to the way tags are used to define the page layout and elements within the page.

## Below is an example of HTML used to define a basic webpage with a title and a single paragraph of text.

\<!DOCTYPE html>   
\<html>   
\<head>    
\<title></title>       
\</head>    
\<body>     
\<h1></h1>    
\</body>     
\</html>     

The first line defines what type of contents the document contains. "<!doctype html>" means the page is written in HTML5. Properly formatted HTML pages should include <html>, <head>, and <body> tags, which are all included in the example above. The page title, metadata, and links to referenced files are placed between the <head> tags. The actual contents of the page go between the <body> tags.
