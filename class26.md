My reading notes for **Class 6**

#### How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?

An object is like a toolbox, it contains a bunch of different tools and nails that you may or may not need to use.

#### What are some advantages to creating object literals?

* When you want to transfer a set of data items.
* Helps with the tedious task of looking back at all your other variables (you can just look at your object literal instead).

#### How do objects differ from arrays?

An array is harder to pull a certain property out of while objects you can just call the property name and the object.

#### Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.

Bracket notation can be useful at times when an object property name is defined at runtime, according to mozilla.org.

#### Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this? const dog = { name: 'Spot', age: 2, color: 'white with black spots', humanAge: function (){ console.log(${this.name} is ${this.age*7} in human years); } } 

This refers the object.

#### What is the DOM?

DOM (Document Object Model) shows all the objects that make up the structure of a webpage.

#### Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.

Javascript is a scripting language that can effect changes to the DOM.

## Things I want to know more about

Spend more time with Object.
