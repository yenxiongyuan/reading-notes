#### Five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

SQL

* Relational DB
* Table Based
* Predefined Schema
* Vertically Scalable
* Uses SQL to manipulate data

NoSQL

* Distributed DB
* Document Based, Key value pairs
* Dynamic schema
* Horizontally Scalable
* Uses UnQL to manipulate data

#### What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment

#### Give a real world example.

Searching for weather of a specific city at a specific time
