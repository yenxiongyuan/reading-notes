My reading notes for **Class 4**


#### What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

An input form element whose value is controlled by React

#### Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

With every keystroke

#### How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

Event.target.value

#### Why would we use a ternary operator?

To shorten code

#### Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:  if(x===y){ console.log(true); } else { console.log(false); }

x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false)
